I wouldn't tell y'all that board helped me if I was tryna cheat
Dustin Jones
I will leave it up to the council then
Murphy Rhodes
the elders will
meet and fiscyss
discuss
Mike Horan
My hint was basically the last 4 letters had to work with a few other starting letters which is most often the case...but I had the G to start which definitely ruled out the word ghost
Also the only reason it helped is bc I sniped the G
Deliberate I made my case

yea u lost me there bones

🤣 i just noticed the score 
good try ninja
Jack Pigou
the desperation and greed from bones just swayed me back to mikey 
Mike Horan
Jack and Murphy must agree 
And I vote still allowing boards to be sent to hope for push it adds some spice to the league 
Jack Pigou
me and murph are deliberating 
Murphy Rhodes
Replied to a message:
this gets dicey
 alright
we have deliberately deliberated. Pigou. take it a way
Jack Pigou
i agree with mikey but mike is notoriously the last person to send is wordle everyday 
Murphy Rhodes
yep
Jack Pigou
so he's the only player who benefits 
Murphy Rhodes
yup
Jack Pigou
but he does feed us pushes so it helps us as well

okay we've come to an agreement 
Murphy Rhodes
yep
Jack Pigou
the push will stand and tm will be 2
BUT
Murphy Rhodes
BUTTT
Jack Pigou
there is foul play that cannot go unpunished.
Dustin being the victim of said foul play will be granted by the jury the power to choose the starter word for mikey on wednesday january 14th as his punishment. 

a good example word to get dustin's brain juices
flowing is oomph.

You guys are actually goats I love that

I'll send my full board at 1am too

Why push? I thought there was foul on the play challenge denied 
Hold up
I won't stand for this
Murphy Rhodes
the elders have spoken
😂
Dustin Jones

Chat, translate this to me
Who sacrificed a goat to keep me from getting points 
Giving Mikey a shit word gives everyone but him an advantage but I was the only one robbed here
Jack Pigou
has to be a majority agreement and the elders deliberated and adjusted accordingly 
Mike Horan
Dustin I could have never said anything about it and just took the push but as league commissioner I felt obligated to disclose my thought process 
Jack Pigou
you also shot yourself in the foot with the scoreboard send 
Murphy Rhodes
yeah Dusty that was a disgusting act
Jack Pigou
you keep this attitude up and the elders will punish you as well chump 
Dustin Jones
You guys already decided no?
I am so confused 
Murphy Rhodes
Jarvis, enhance
😂
Mike Horan
I do agree Dustin gets slightly shafted
Dustin Jones
What did I do wrong?
Mike Horan
Hold up....I have an idea
Murphy Rhodes

Mike Horan
Jack and Murphy create a custom Wordle...if Dustin wins he gets the skins, if I push or better it pushes
Murphy Rhodes
Replied to a message:
this is an interesting proposal. the elders will discuss
Dustin Jones

This was all I saw when I sent the scoreboard 
I want my two this is some bullshit 
Script writers gotta do better 
Y'all both said Mikey was guilty then changed your mind?
Imma crash out
Jack Pigou
i mean i was kinda just feeding into the hype of the moment 
Murphy Rhodes
me too
Dustin Jones
Some bullshit. Custom word idea is fun and all but I got a 3 today fair and square and I'm not getting my points
Jack Pigou
i mean if we're being real, it's not that deep seeing another persons board lol we all get sent wordles from other ppl 
‼️
Jack Pigou
mikey sniped you, it really wasn't cheating 
i know you see riley's board every day lol 
to be clear the only other board i see is my moms which is like once a week and i always finish my wordle before her so 
Murphy Rhodes
Replied to a message:
i do not
Mike Horan
Honestly I believe my guess was fully legit...I definitely ruled out 1 word which is ghost but I would have avoided that word anyway bc it's definitely been an answer before 
Dustin Jones
Riley and I don't do Wordle anymore and Donna games late
But I'll rest my case and accept the decision 
Murphy Rhodes
Jarvis, jerk it a little 
❤️
Jack Pigou
but you have gamed late before which means there have been times you've seen donna's board before guessing 
Dustin Jones
I just hide the notification 

I do think we should establish an honor code rule of not viewing other boards before we submit our own so it's in writing 

I think it actually takes a lot of effort to look someone else's board and put the pieces together. You know if you're guilty 
Mike Horan
 I sent you my mom's emojis for a reason bc it was pretty blatant that I sniped the first letter and she sniped the last 4, not much thinking went into it
Final decision, in the next case where I am leading/pushed for best score, Dustin may request my emojis once.
Dustin Jones
I'll let sleeping dogs lie but I submit a request to the board to consider my suggestion. It's easy enough to reply to all our respective Donna's later
I wish to submit a starting word for Mikey for the 13th of January on the 2,026th year of our lord
Mike Horan
That is fair. No board hints outside of this chat. I think keeping board hints here is low-key electric 
You rather submit my starting word than take my board hint??
Dustin Jones
I would 
I am honestly not the most talented at reading boards
Mike Horan
Say less gimme the word beast...do I have to give a board hint too??
Murphy Rhodes
Dustin just rip the band aid off. give him the word
