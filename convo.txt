But if we do an end date we can make skins worth $3
$4**
$1 from each of us per day
But then someone could get RINSED
Murphy Rhodes

$1 is fine bc you win skins too, it will just rinse someone if they barely get any skins 
So over 50 days if score is
20 (win $80 net +30)
15 (win $60 net +10)
10 (win $40 net -10)
5 (win $20 net -30)

Jack Pigou
bruh 
Murphy Rhodes
yes
Mike Horan
That's how it should be played tbh
If you suck ass you get rinsed if you do well you get rewarded
Lfg
