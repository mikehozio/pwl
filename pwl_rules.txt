Rules:
- Everyone MUST use Hard mode (found in the settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right) This setting requires you to use every letter that has been guessed correctly in previous guesses.

- No cheating, or using hints. This is an honorable game played by honorable people. Don't be a bitch. If the answer is spoiled for you, respectfully forfeit your daily submission.

- When submitting your score, you may opt to remove the emoji tiles that indicate how you guessed the word, this could provide hints to other players.

- Seasons end with first to 50 points or 90 days

Scoring:
- An outright winner will be awarded 3+ points**

- 2 way tie - each player awarded 2 points

- 3 way tie - 1 point each

- 4+ way tie no points are awarded

**The outright winner points will be awarded using a bounty system. The bounty points start at 1 and increase each day there is no outright winner. The bounty IS the winner points, but a winner will always receive at least 3 points. So until the bounty reaches 4 there is technically no bonus.
